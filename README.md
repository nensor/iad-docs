# OSTI Interagency Data API DOI service

This repository is intended to host online documentation for the OSTI Interagency Data API (IAD) 
REST API services.

About the service
-----------------
The Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) became a member and an allocation agency for DataCite in 2011. OSTI assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to Department of Energy datasets and registers those DOIs with DataCite. The Interagency Data ID Service (IAD), developed and operated by OSTI, provides this same service to other U.S. Federal Agencies desiring to make their data available for citation and discovery long into the future.

The IAD REST API
----------------
The IAD REST API is provided to clients in order to facilitate and maintain registration of Digital 
Object Identifiers (DOIs) for various text, data, or other media resources.  These DOIs link directly
to the work itself, or landing pages detailing information about the work.

The service is maintained by the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI). For additional
information, see https://www.osti.gov/iad2/ or email iad@osti.gov.
